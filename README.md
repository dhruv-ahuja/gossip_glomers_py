# README

My attempt at [Gossip Glomers](https://fly.io/dist-sys/) challenges in Python -- was facing some weird issues with Go so went with Python for the time being,
might re-attempt them at some point in Go or other languages.

## setup

I have added path to the maelstrom binary as a shell alias for ease of use.

Also set `EXPORT PYTHONPATH=$PWD` in the shell session to prevent import errors when running the code.
